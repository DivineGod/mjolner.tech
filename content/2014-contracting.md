While on a Working Holiday Visa I did some contracting in the first few months of my time in Melbourne.

Getting acquainted with a technology stack in a new place was no problem for me and I was able to deliver great results for clients.

My main focus was in design agencies and in roles with a Front-end focus. I build marketing sites in angular and work on projects in javascript and nodejs as well.
