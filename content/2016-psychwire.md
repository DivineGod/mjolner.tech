Psychwire creates immersive, interactive, and comprehensive online courses rooted in world-leading, evidence-based theory.

As Senior Developer, I worked closely with the back-end team to ensure smooth student registration, bug-free course delivery, and efficient stakeholder interactions.

Working remotely, I thrived in the autonomy of the role, sharpening my time management and communication skills. This experience allowed me to work independently while contributing to the teamâ€™s success, managing tasks effectively, and consistently delivering high-quality results.

I delivered numerous features across both legacy and greenfield codebases, contributing to the overall product development. In collaboration with payment processing platforms, I built tools for invoicing, streamlining financial workflows and enhancing user experience.
