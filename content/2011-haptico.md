Project lead and full-stack software developer gameglobe.com. An online action adventure game with social aspects and a game world creation hosting platform.

Built the front-end and back-end for a django-powered website with social features hosting an online action adventure game creator. Allowing users to create and play unlimited worlds. The front-end was built in javascript and backbone.js. Extensive unit tests were maintained for the python back-end using the unittest library.

I managed continuous integration and deployment with hosting in AWS using S3, EC2, and SES.
