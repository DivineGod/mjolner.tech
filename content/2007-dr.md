# Summary

My first permanent full-time role after finishing my studies. As my final project for my degree
was done in collaboration with the team at Danish Broadcating Corporation I was hired to continue
my work with them.

Built out a system for online chat using the XMPP protocol with ejabberd on the back-end and Ajax (XMLHTTPRequest) on the front-end.

In my role as Web Developer I built an n-gram text classifier in C#.
I worked on wordpress plugins for automating publishing pipelines and caching for articles
heading to the youth portal of dr.dk.
Worked collaboratively with a team of 4 other developers to build a prototype social media platform.
