Born August 1984 in Copenhagen, Denmark. I've been fascinated by computers since I was young. First learning Basic on PC and then as a teen getting into C, C++, and web technologies once the internet got around to our place in 1996

In 2014 I decided to go on a Working Holiday to Australia. Little did I know that I'd fall in love with the place and the people here.

# Hobbies and Interests

I love tinkering with electronics, both building hardware and embedded software.

LEGO has been a constant source of creativity for me (as is required for someone born in Denmark, the birthplace of LEGO).

I'm a certified PADI Scuba Instructor and love exploring the underwater world.
